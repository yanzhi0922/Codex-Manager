## Recent Changes
- Current latest version: `v0.1.8` (2026-03-11)
- This release rolls up the latest protocol compatibility work, login-path alignment, gateway error handling, desktop interaction fixes, Web auth hardening, and long-term maintainability refactors; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full history.
- The dashboard now adds an account-pool view as well: the new aggregate remaining-usage card for 5-hour / 7-day windows is computed on the backend and wired into both startup snapshot loading and the auto-refresh path, so it keeps updating even as the account pool grows.
- The Codex login-account request path is now closer to upstream behavior: ChatGPT-backed turns now use `access_token` directly, no longer mixing in `api_key_access_token` semantics, and the default `https://api.openai.com/v1` fallback has been removed so local fallback errors no longer rewrite upstream challenge / `403` outcomes.
- The `401` recovery chain is now in place as well: when a ChatGPT login-account request returns `401`, CodexManager refreshes the local `access_token` with the stored `refresh_token` and retries the current request once, replacing the older stateless `401` retry behavior.
- Gateway runtime and diagnostics are stronger: synthetic gateway failures now return structured OpenAI-style `error.message / error.type / error.code` payloads while keeping trace and error-code headers, long-running SSE turns are more resilient to idle disconnects, and the Settings page now exposes upstream stream timeout and SSE keepalive controls with runtime hot reload.
- Desktop behavior was tightened as well: startup now restores dashboard / account / request-log snapshots earlier, successful login refreshes the accounts table automatically, and platform-key creation plus upstream-proxy save flows were cleaned up.
- The Web auth flow is safer: `codexmanager-web` still persists the password, but authenticated sessions are now scoped to the current Web process, so old cookies do not survive a full close-and-reopen cycle.
- The project is also undergoing long-term maintainability refactoring: the frontend entry/runtime layers, settings flow, request-log UI, Tauri command surface, service lifecycle, gateway protocol adapter, HTTP bridge, and upstream execution flow have all been split further into clearer module boundaries.
- The release pipeline stays consolidated under `release-all.yml` for one-click Windows / macOS / Linux publishing, with local frontend build fallback when prebuilt artifacts are unavailable.

## Features
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes
- Bulk import / export: multi-file import, recursive desktop folder import for JSON, one-file-per-account export
- Usage dashboard: 5-hour + 7-day windows, plus accounts that only expose a 7-day window
- OAuth login: browser flow + manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding
- Local service with configurable port
- Local OpenAI-compatible gateway for CLI and third-party tools

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to Accounts, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Page Overview
### Desktop
- Accounts: bulk import/export, refresh accounts and usage
- Platform Keys: bind keys by model and inspect request logs
- Settings: manage ports, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: browser-based management UI
- `codexmanager-start`: one command to launch service + web
